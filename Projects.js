        fullDescription: "This comprehensive exterior renovation brought new life to a beautiful estate home. The project began with thorough surface preparation including pressure washing and crack repair to ensure longevity. We applied a premium two-coat paint system specifically formulated to withstand Zambia's intense sun and seasonal rains. The elegant forest green body is beautifully offset by cream-colored trim and sophisticated burgundy accent details on shutters and architectural features. The result is enhanced curb appeal with protection that will last for years to come.",

        fullDescription: "This corporate office transformation was completed over a weekend to avoid disrupting business operations. The project focused on creating a professional environment that reflects the company's brand identity while promoting productivity. We used low-VOC paints to ensure air quality and employee comfort, with a sophisticated corporate blue as the primary color paired with neutral grays and crisp whites. The main conference room features a bold accent wall that serves as a dynamic backdrop for presentations. Modern, clean lines and careful attention to detail throughout create a workspace that employees and clients alike can appreciate.",
